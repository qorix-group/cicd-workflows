# Reusable GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository contains **reusable GitHub Actions workflows** designed to standardize CI/CD processes across multiple repositories
in `SCORE`. 
These workflows integrate with **Bazel** and provide a consistent way to run **documentation builds, license checks, static analysis, tests, and copyright verification**

## Available Workflows

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|------------|
| **Documentation Build** | Builds project documentation and deploys it to GitHub Pages |
| **License Check** | Verifies OSS licenses and compliance |
| **Static Code Analysis** | Runs Clang-Tidy, Clippy, Pylint, and other linters based on project type |
| **Tests** | Executes tests using GoogleTest, Rust test or pytest |
| **Copyright Check** | Ensures all source files have the required copyright headers |

## Using the Workflows in Your Repository

To use a reusable workflow, create a workflow file inside **your repository** (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and reference the appropriate workflow from this repository.

### **1️ Documentation Build Workflow**
**Usage Example**
```yaml 
name: Documentation CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docs:
    uses: eclipse-score/ci_cd_repo/.github/workflows/docs.yml@main
    with:
      retention-days: 3
```
This workflow:

✅ Builds project documentation  
✅ Uploads it as an artifact  
✅ Deploys it to **GitHub Pages** on push to `main`  

> ⚠️ **Note:** We will clarify the `docs` target after it gets decoupled from the current `score` repo.

---

### **2️ License Check Workflow**
**Usage Example**
```yaml
name: License Check CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  license-check:
    uses: eclipse-score/ci_cd_repo/.github/workflows/license-check.yml@main
    with:
      repo-url: "${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}" # optional, this is the default
      bazel-target: "run //:license-check" # optional, this is the default
    secrets:
      gitlab-api-token: ${{ secrets.ECLIPSE_GITLAB_API_TOKEN }} #optional
```

This workflow:

✅ Runs **DASH license compliance checks** for **Rust, C++, and Python**  
✅ Uses the **organization secret** `ECLIPSE_GITLAB_API_TOKEN`  
✅ Comments results directly on the **Pull Request**

> ℹ️ **Note:** You can override the Bazel command using the `bazel-target` input.  
> **Default:** `run //:license-check`

---

### **3️ Static Code Analysis Workflow**
**Usage Example**
```yaml
name: Static Analysis CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  static-analysis:
    uses: eclipse-score/ci_cd_repo/.github/workflows/static-analysis.yml@main
    with:
      bazel-target: "run //:static-analysis" # optional, this is the default
```

This workflow:
✅ Runs **Clang-Tidy** for C++  
✅ Runs **Rust Clippy, Cargo Audit, and Cargo Geiger** for Rust  
✅ Runs **Pylint** for Python  

> ℹ️ **Note:** You can override the Bazel command using the `bazel-target` input.  
> **Default:** `run //:static-analysis`

---

### **4️ Tests Workflow**
**Usage Example**
```yaml
name: Test CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  tests:
    uses: eclipse-score/ci_cd_repo/.github/workflows/tests.yml@main
```

This workflow:
✅ Runs **GoogleTest** for C++  
✅ Runs **Rust Unit Tests**  
✅ Runs **pytest** for Python  

---

### **5️ Copyright Check Workflow**
**Usage Example**
```yaml
name: Copyright Check CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  copyright-check:
    uses: eclipse-score/ci_cd_repo/.github/workflows/copyright.yml@main
    with:
      bazel-target: "run //:copyright-check" # optional, this is the default
```

This workflow:
✅ Runs a **Bazel-based copyright**
✅ Ensures all source files have **Eclipse Foundation** headers

> ℹ️ **Note:** You can override the Bazel command using the `bazel-target` input.  
> **Default:** `run //:copyright-check`

---

##  How to Update Workflows
Since these workflows are centralized, updates in the `ci_cd_repo` repository will **automatically apply to all repositories using them**. If you need a specific version, reference a **tagged release** instead of `main`:
```yaml
uses: eclipse-score/ci_cd_repo/.github/workflows/tests.yml@v1.0.0
```

---

### **Summary**
✅ **Standardized** CI/CD workflows across all projects  
✅ **Reusable & Maintainable** with centralized updates  
✅ **Bazel-powered** for consistent testing & analysis
